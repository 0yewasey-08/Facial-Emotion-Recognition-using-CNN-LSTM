# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-CNN-LSTM
Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a significant research area in computer vision that focuses on identifying human emotions from facial expressions. It plays an important role in application such as emotion-aware systems. This project implements a deep learning based facial emotion recognition system using a CNN and LSTM model.
